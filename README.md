Investigating the Prison Pipeline
Members: 
Adina Raizen				Henry Luken				Patrick Aubry 
Introduction
Given demographics, like health, income status, social class, geography, etc. can we predict with relative certainty if you will spend any time incarcerated?

Further, what are the factors that affect if you are arrested, if you are jailed, and further, if you are incarcerated. 

Essentially, what factors affect the Prison Pipeline. 
Overview
There will be several factors to investigate for this presentation about the Prison Pipeline. Namely: 
Policing
What are factors that contribute to over and under policing given demographics?
Arrest
What are the factors that contribute to a person being arrested for a given crime, geography, ethnicity, race,?
Incarceration
What are the factors that contribute to a person being incarcerated?

Presenting findings
Our plan is to: 
 Present a visual story that describes the factors mentioned above
 Create and train a complex model to predict a person's likelihood to be incarcerated at some point in their life.
