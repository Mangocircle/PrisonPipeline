## Introduction
The main goal of this project is to investigate the factors that influence policing and incarceration, with a particular focus on the city of Lancaster, CA. The project aims to explore the prison pipeline and understand why certain demographics, especially Black men in their 20s and 30s, are disproportionately affected by encounters with police and subsequent arrests. By examining relevant data and leveraging machine learning, the project seeks to develop a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of an individual's arrest based on basic demographics.

By shedding light on the factors influencing arrests and policing disparities in Lancaster, CA, this project aims to raise awareness about systemic issues and contribute to evidence-based policy-making. The findings and predictive model can be used to guide law enforcement practices, promote social justice, and develop intervention strategies aimed at reducing incarceration rates and fostering a fairer criminal justice system.

## Methodology
The project focuses on Lancaster, CA, examining data related to police encounters and arrests. Factors that were considered include race, gender, homelessness, and disability. 

The primary data source used is the 2019 [Los Angeles County Sheriffâ€™s Deputy Contacts in Lancaster dataset](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/los-angeles-county-sheriffs-deputy-contacts-in-lancaster) from propublica.org. Additional demographic data was pulled from the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/lancastercitycalifornia/RHI225222#RHI225222).

This project is comprised of two parts:
1. Data Analysis
2. Predictive Model

### Data Analysis
First, the dataset was analyzed to find patterns and themes related to the factors that are involved in the outcomes of police interactions. Tableau was used to create visualizations demonstrating these themes. The data regarding police encounters in Lancaster, CA was combined with demographic information from the city in order to draw additional conclusions about disparities in policing.

### Predictive Model
Next, machine learning models were applied to the police encounters data in an effort to create a predictive model. In order to do this, the data was first cleaned, maintaining fields with demographic information and combining fields to create a target field indicating whether an encounter resulted in an arrest. 

Several types of models were tested, including logistic regression, random forest, and neural network. Each model was analyzed for accuracy, with each model maxing out around 62% accuracy overall. A great deal of testing was employed when designing the neural network, including trying various combinations of numbers of neurons and layers, types of activation layers used, drop-out rates, and optimizer types. 

In the process of model optimization, various manipulations of the data were tested as well, including binning ages into groups of 5-year spans, binning gender and race categories to simplify the data, and removing the disability category. Through trial and error, the group incorporated the changes that led to the highest accuracy of the model, taking care to not over-fit the model to the data. 

Once the most optimized model was found, using a Keras sequential neural network model in TensorFlow, an app was created using Python to allow a user to input several demographics and receive a result indicating whether they are likely or unlikely to be arrested in Lancaster, CA following an encounter with the police.

## Current Conclusions
In analyzing the data, several themes emerge:

White people are less likely to be arrested if they are homeless, as opposed to people of color who are more likely to be arrested.

People 45 and older are much less likely to get arrested following an encounter with the police than younger people (specifically 20-44).

Black and Hispanic people are arrested the most.

Compared to the racial breakdown of the general population of Lancaster, Black people are disproportionately more likely to have encounters, be arrested, and have force used against them by the police.

Additionally, using machine learning, a predictor app was created that predicts whether a person is likely to be arrested if they encounter the police, based on demographic information provided. While the model was only able to achieve about 62% accuracy, a more accurate app could be developed in the future with more data.

In analyzing the recall and precision rates of the logistic regression model, there was a 77% recall rate for predicting arrests. So, while the overall accuracy was below the desired 75% threshold, the recall rate is important to consider when evaluating the effectiveness of the model. When predicting arrest likelihood, recall takes precedence over accuracy because the primary concern is identifying individuals who are likely to be arrested. This is especially important for addressing bias, systemic issues, and disparities within the criminal justice system. By maximizing recall, the model strives to create a fairer and more effective predictive approach.

## Future Opportunities
Moving forward, the group aims to expand this analysis to encompass the entire incarceration process. This includes investigating the factors that increase an individual's likelihood of being incarcerated and understanding the drivers of recidivism. The objective is to create a comprehensive model that highlights the complexities of the criminal justice system, with a focus on addressing and mitigating disparities and systemic biases.
